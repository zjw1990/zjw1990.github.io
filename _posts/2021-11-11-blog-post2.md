I will be graduate in earlier 2022. Currently I am waiting for my final defence. As a Ph.D student at Massey University for 4 years, I have developed excellent research skills in deep learning driven data science. Additionally, after working over a year in top data labs in both academic and industry, I have advanced knowledge in developing online application, and dealing with complex data.
